      ## Structure
      Humans are born with four types of tonsils: the pharyngeal tonsil, two
      tubal tonsils, two palatine tonsils, and the lingual tonsils.[1]

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the location of the tubal tonsils?
        answer: The location of the tubal tonsils is the roof of the pharynx.
      - question: |
          Compare the epithelial types, encapsulation, and presence of
          crypts in the pharyngeal, tubal, and palatine tonsils according to the
          table provided.
        answer: |
          The pharyngeal tonsil features ciliated pseudostratified columnar
          epithelium and is incompletely encapsulated with small folds sometimes
          described as crypts. The tubal tonsils also have ciliated
          pseudostratified columnar epithelium but are not encapsulated and do
          not possess crypts. In contrast, the palatine tonsils are covered with
          stratified squamous epithelium, are fully encapsulated, and contain
          multiple deep crypts. These structural differences are indicative of
          their varied anatomical locations and potentially their distinct
          functions within the immune system.
      - question: What type of epithelium is found in the pharyngeal tonsil?
        answer: |
          The type of epithelium found in the pharyngeal tonsil is ciliated
          pseudostratified columnar (respiratory epithelium).


  - context: |
      The **tonsils** are a set of [lymphoid](Lymphatic_system "wikilink")
      organs facing into the aerodigestive tract, which is known as
      [Waldeyer's tonsillar ring](Waldeyer's_tonsillar_ring "wikilink") and
      consists of the [adenoid tonsil](adenoid "wikilink") (or pharyngeal
      tonsil), two [tubal tonsils](tubal_tonsil "wikilink"), two [palatine
      tonsils](palatine_tonsil "wikilink"), and the [lingual
      tonsils](lingual_tonsil "wikilink"). These organs play an important role
      in the immune system.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the immune system's first line of defense?
        answer: |
          The tonsils are the immune system's first line of defense against
          ingested or inhaled foreign pathogens.
      - question: What is Waldeyer's tonsillar ring?
        answer: |
          Waldeyer's tonsillar ring is a set of lymphoid organs facing into the
          aerodigestive tract, consisting of the adenoid tonsil, two tubal
          tonsils, two palatine tonsils, and the lingual tonsils.
      - question: How many tubal tonsils are part of Waldeyer's tonsillar ring?
        answer: There are two tubal tonsils as part of Waldeyer's tonsillar ring.

  - context: |
      The palatine tonsils tend to reach their largest size in [puberty](puberty
      "wikilink"), and they gradually undergo [atrophy](atrophy "wikilink")
      thereafter. However, they are largest relative to the diameter of the
      throat in young children. In adults, each palatine tonsil normally
      measures up to 2.5 cm in length, 2.0 cm in width and 1.2 cm in
      thickness.[2]

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: When do the palatine tonsils tend to reach their largest size?
        answer: The palatine tonsils tend to reach their largest size in puberty.
      - question: What are the typical dimensions of an adult palatine tonsil?
        answer: |
          In adults, each palatine tonsil normally measures up to 2.5 cm in
          length, 2.0 cm in width, and 1.2 cm in thickness.
      - question: How do the palatine tonsils change in size with age?
        answer: |
          The palatine tonsils tend to gradually undergo atrophy after puberty,
          becoming smaller in size compared to their dimensions in young
          children.

  - context: |
      The tonsils are immunocompetent organs that serve as the immune system's
      first line of defense against ingested or inhaled foreign pathogens, and
      as such frequently engorge with blood to assist in immune responses to
      common illnesses such as the common cold. The tonsils have on their
      surface specialized antigen capture cells called [microfold
      cells](microfold_cell "wikilink") (M cells) that allow for the uptake of
      antigens produced by pathogens. These M cells then alert the B cells and T
      cells in the tonsil that a pathogen is present and an immune response is
      stimulated.[3] B cells are activated and proliferate in areas called
      germinal centers in the tonsil. These germinal centers are places where B
      memory cells are created and [secretory antibody (IgA)](Immunoglobulin_A
      "wikilink") is produced.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are the specialized antigen capture cells on the surface of the
          tonsils called?
        answer: |
          The specialized antigen capture cells on the surface of the tonsils
          are called microfold cells (M cells).
      - question: What is the role of microfold cells in the tonsils?
        answer: |
          Microfold cells (M cells) allow for the uptake of antigens produced by
          pathogens. They alert the B cells and T cells in the tonsil that a
          pathogen is present, stimulating an immune response.
      - question: Where do B cells proliferate in the tonsils?
        answer: B cells proliferate in areas called germinal centers in the tonsils.

  - context: |
      A [tonsillolith](tonsillolith "wikilink") (also known as a "tonsil stone")
      is material that accumulates on the palatine tonsil. This can reach the
      size of a [peppercorn](peppercorn "wikilink") and is white or cream in
      color. The main substance is mostly [calcium](calcium "wikilink"), but it
      has a strong unpleasant odor because of [hydrogen
      sulfide](hydrogen_sulfide "wikilink") and [methyl
      mercaptan](methyl_mercaptan "wikilink") and other chemicals.[6]

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is a tonsillolith?
        answer: |
          A tonsillolith (tonsil stone) is material that accumulates on the
          palatine tonsil, reaching the size of a peppercorn and having a white
          or cream color. It contains calcium and has a strong unpleasant odor
          due to hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and other chemicals.
      - question: What is the main substance found in a tonsillolith?
        answer: The main substance found in a tonsillolith is mostly calcium.
      - question: Why do tonsilloliths have a strong unpleasant odor?
        answer: |
          Tonsilloliths have a strong unpleasant odor due to hydrogen sulfide,
          methyl mercaptan, and other chemicals.
