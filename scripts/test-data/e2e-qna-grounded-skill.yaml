- context: >
    Document:

    All regular employees except those on a leave of absence (LOA) must file Form XYZ.
    If you are a regular employee on a LOA, you do not need to file the form. If you
    are a supplemental employee (type B1, type B2, or type B3), your employee type
    determines which form you must file, as follows:

    * If you are a type B1 employee, you must follow the same rules that apply to the
    regular employees.

    * If you are a type B2 employee, the rules that apply to you are different from
    those that apply to the regular employees. See Pub. 31416 to find out which forms
    you should file.

    * If you are a supplemental employee of neither type B1 nor type B2, you are a
    type B3 employee. Different rules apply for each part of the year. For information
    on type B3 employees, see Pub. 31416.
  question: >
    User asks the following question:

    "I am a supplemental employee of type B1 on a LOA. Should I file Form XYZ?"

    As the responding agent, do you have enough information to provide a yes-or-no answer
    to the user's question? Answer Yes or No, then explain your answer.
  answer: >
    Yes, I have enough information to provide a yes-or-no answer to the user's question.
    Specifically, the answer to the user's question is "no". Indeed, the user is a
    supplemental employee of type B1 and is on a LOA. According to the document,
    supplemental employees of type B1 must follow the same rules that apply to the
    regular employees, and a regular employee on a LOA does not need to file Form XYZ.
    Hence, the user does not need to file Form XYZ. I reached this conclusion using
    only the information available in the document and in the user's question.

    User asks the following question:

    "I am a supplemental employee of type B1, not on a LOA. Should I file Form XYZ?"

    As the responding agent, do you have enough information to provide a yes-or-no answer
    to the user's question? Answer Yes or No, then explain your answer.
  answer: >
    Yes, I have enough information to provide a yes-or-no answer to the user's question.
    Specifically, the answer to the user's question is "yes". Indeed, the user is a
    supplemental employee of type B1 and is not on a LOA. According to the document,
    supplemental employees of type B1 must follow the same rules that apply to the
    regular employees, and all regular employees except those on a LOA must file
    Form XYZ. Hence, the user must file Form XYZ. I reached this conclusion using only
    the information available in the document and in the user's question.

    Document:

    The Helping Hands Program enables the employees of XYZ Technologies to support
    nonprofit organizations within the communities where the employees live and work.
    All active, regular employees of XYZ Technologies are eligible to participate in
    the program. The following categories are ineligible to participate in the program:

    * Retirees who no longer work at XYZ Technologies

    * XYZ employees on a leave of absence

    * Supplemental employees and contractors who are not regular XYZ employees

    Please note that XYZ employees on a leave of absence can participate in the Helping
    Hands Program once they return to an active status.
  question: >
    User asks the following question:

    "I am an active, regular employee of XYZ Technologies. I am not on a leave of absence.
    Can I participate in the Helping Hands Program?"

    As the responding agent, do you have enough information to provide a yes-or-no answer
    to the user's question? Answer Yes or No, then explain your answer.
  answer: >
    Yes, I have enough information to provide a yes-or-no answer to the user's question.
    Specifically, the answer to the user's question is "yes". Indeed, the user is an
    active, regular employee of XYZ Technologies. According to the document, all active,
    regular employees of XYZ Technologies are eligible to participate in the Helping
    Hands Program. The document excludes retirees, XYZ employees on a leave of absence,
    and those who are not regular XYZ employees; however, the user is an active and
    regular employee who is not on a leave of absence, so the exclusions do not apply.
    Therefore, the user can participate in the Helping Hands Program. I reached this
    conclusion using only the information available in the document and in the user's
    question.

    Document:

    Applying for a driver's license is as easy as 1-2-3! You can apply for a driver's license
    if you bring documents from each of the three sections below:

    Section 1. Proof of Identity - one document is required from the list below:

    * Unexpired passport

    * Birth certificate

    * Certificate of naturalization or citizenship

    * Valid, unexpired Permanent Resident Card

    Section 2. Proof of Social Security Number - one document is required from the list below:

    * Social Security card

    * W-2 form

    * SSA-1099 form

    * Paystub

    Section 3. Proof of Residency - two different documents are required from the list below:

    * Home utility bill

    * Medical document

    * Proof of car registration

    * Proof of employment

    * Proof of insurance

    * Mortgage bill

    * Lease agreement

    * Tax return
  question: >
    User asks the following question:

    "Can I apply for a driver's license if I bring my birth certificate, my W-2 form, and
    my proof of car registration?"

    As the responding agent, do you have enough information to provide a yes-or-no answer
    to the user's question? Answer Yes or No, then explain your answer.
  answer: >
    Yes, I have enough information to provide a yes-or-no answer to the user's question.
    Specifically, the answer to the user's question is "no". Indeed, the user wants to
    bring a birth certificate, a W-2 form, and a proof of car registration. According to
    the context document, to apply for a driver's license, the user must bring one proof
    of Identity, one proof of Social Security Number, and two different proof of Residency
    documents. A birth certificate is one proof of Identity, a W-2 form is one proof of
    Social Security Number, and a proof of car registration is one proof of Residency
    document. The user cannot apply for a driver's license without bringing a second proof
    of Residency document. I reached this conclusion using only the information available
    in the context document and in the user's question.

    Document:

    XYZ Corporation released three models of phones in 2024: Model MX, Model MY, and
    Model MZ. Model MX is the budget-conscious choice, it has 6-inch screen, a single
    rear camera, and 32 GB of storage. Model MY is the most portable choice, with a
    5-inch screen, a dual rear camera, and 32 GB of storage. Model MZ is the luxury
    choice, sporting a 7-inch screen, a dual rear camera, and 64 GB of storage.
    These three models are the only ones available for sale in our store.
  question: >
    User asks the following question:

    "Does your store sell a phone made by XYZ Corporation that has a 6-inch screen and
    a dual rear camera?"

    As the responding agent, do you have enough information to provide a yes-or-no answer
    to the user's question? Answer Yes or No, then explain your answer.
  answer: >
    Yes, I have enough information to provide a yes-or-no answer to the user's question.
    Specifically, the answer to the user's question is "no". Indeed, the user is looking
    for a phone made by XYZ Corporation that has a 6-inch screen and a dual rear camera.
    According to the document, our store sells only three models of phones made by
    XYZ Corporation: Model MX, Model MY, and Model MZ. Only Model MX has a 6-inch screen,
    but it has a single rear camera; models MY and MZ do not have a 6-inch screen. Hence,
    our store does not sell a phone the user is looking for. I reached this conclusion
    using only the information available in the document and in the user's question.

    Solar System Overview

    The solar system has one star, eight planets, five dwarf planets, at least 290 moons,
    more than 1.3 million asteroids, and about 3,900 comets. It is located in an outer
    spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur. Our solar
    system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes
    about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.

    We call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything
    bound to it by gravity - the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
    Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris - along
    with hundreds of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.
  question: >
    User asks the following question:

    "Does the solar system have two stars?"

    As the responding agent, do you have enough information to provide a yes-or-no answer
    to the user's question? Answer Yes or No, then explain your answer.
  answer: >
    Yes, I have enough information to provide a yes-or-no answer to the user's question.
    Specifically, the answer to the user's question is "no". According to the document,
    the solar system has only one star - the Sun, not two stars. I reached this
    conclusion using only the information available in the document and in the user's
    question.
