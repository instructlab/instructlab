# CLI for TBD

This is the command-line interface for TBD...

## Pre-reqs

 * Python 3.9 or later
   * CLang distribution of Python: 15.0.0 (xcode)
* MacOS
  * 14.x with M1/M2/M3 (Metal/GPU)

**Note:** The steps shown use [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for virtual environments. If you have used [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [Conda Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) or another tool for Python version management on your laptop, then use the virtual environment with that tool instead. Otherwise, you may have issues with packages installed but modules from that package not found as they are linked to you Python version management tool and not `venv`.

## Usage

To run from source, clone this repo.

```shell
cd <repo root>
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Always be sure to activate the *venv* in your working shell.

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Run CLI as follows:

```ShellSession
$ python -m cli
Usage: python -m cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
