## Welcome to the InstructLab CLI

InstructLab 🥼 uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for
Large Language Models (LLMs.) The "**lab**" in Instruct**Lab** 🥼 stands for
[**L**arge-Scale **A**lignment for Chat**B**ots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081) [1].

[1] Shivchander Sudalairaj*, Abhishek Bhandwaldar*, Aldo Pareja*, Kai Xu, David D. Cox, Akash Srivastava*. "LAB: Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots", arXiv preprint arXiv: 2403.01081, 2024. (* denotes equal contributions)

## ❓ What is `ilab`

`ilab` is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool that allows you to:

1. Download a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM).
2. Chat with the LLM.

To add new knowledge and skills to the pre-trained LLM you have to add new information to the companion [taxonomy](https://github.com/instruct-lab/taxonomy.git) repository.
After that is done, you can:

1. Use `ilab` to generate new synthetic training data based on the changes in your local `taxonomy` repository.
2. Re-train the LLM with the new training data.
3. Chat with the re-trained LLM to see the results.

The full process is described graphically in the [workflow diagram](./docs/workflow.png).

## 📋 Requirements

- **🍎 Apple M1/M2/M3 Mac or 🐧 Linux system** (tested on Fedora). We anticipate support for more operating systems in the future.
- C++ compiler
- Python 3.9+
- Approximately 60GB disk space (entire process)


## ✅ Getting started

### 🧰 Installing `ilab`

1. If you are on Fedora Linux, install C++, Python 3.9+, and other necessary tools by running the following command:

    ```shell
   sudo dnf install g++ gcc make pip python3 python3-devel python3-GitPython
   ```

   Optional: If g++ is not found, try 'gcc-c++' by running the following command:

     ```shell
     sudo dnf install gcc-c++ gcc make pip python3 python3-devel python3-GitPython
     ```

2. Create a new directory called `instruct-lab` to store the files the `ilab` CLI needs when running and CD into the directory by running the following command:

   ```shell
   mkdir instruct-lab
   cd instruct-lab
   ```

   > **NOTE:** The following steps in this document use [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for virtual environments. However, if you use another tool such as [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [Conda Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) for managing Python environments on your machine continue to use that tool instead. Otherwise, you may have issues with packages that are installed but not found in `venv`.

3. Install and activate your `venv` environment by running the following command:

   ```shell
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/instruct-lab/cli.git@stable
   ```
   > **NOTE**: ⏳ `pip install` may take some time, depending on your internet connection.

4. From your `venv` environment, verify `ilab` is installed correctly, by running the `ilab` command.

   ```shell
   ilab
   ```

   #### Example output:
   ```
   (venv) $ ilab
   Usage: ilab [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

   CLI for interacting with InstructLab.

   If this is your first time running `ilab`, it's best to start with `ilab init`
   to create the environment

   Options:
   --config PATH  Path to a configuration file.  [default: config.yaml]
   --help         Show this message and exit.

   Commands:
   chat      Run a chat using the modified model
   check     Check that taxonomy is valid
   convert   Converts model to GGUF
   download  Download the model(s) to train
   generate  Generates synthetic data to enhance your example data
   init      Initializes environment for InstructLab
   list      Lists taxonomy files that have changed since a reference commit (default origin/main)
   serve     Start a local server
   test      Runs basic test to ensure model correctness
   train     Takes synthetic data generated locally with `ilab generate`...
   ```

   > **IMPORTANT:** every `ilab` command needs to be run from within your Python virtual environment. To enter the Python environment, run the following command:

   ```shell
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

### 🏗️ Initialize `ilab`

1. Initialize `ilab` by running the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab init
   ```

   #### Example output:

   ```shell
   Welcome to InstructLab CLI. This guide will help you set up your environment.
   Please provide the following values to initiate the environment [press Enter for defaults]:
   Path to taxonomy repo [taxonomy]: <ENTER>
   ```

2. When prompted by the interface, press **Enter** to add a new default `config.yaml` file.

3. When prompted, clone the `git@github.com:instruct-lab/taxonomy.git` repository into the current directory by typing **y**.

   **Optional**: If you want to point to an existing local clone of the `taxonomy` repository, you can pass the path interactively or alternatively with the `--taxonomy-path` flag.

   #### Example output:

   ```shell
   (venv) $ ilab init
   Welcome to InstructLab CLI. This guide will help you set up your environment.
   Please provide the following values to initiate the environment [press Enter for defaults]:
   Path to taxonomy repo [taxonomy]: <ENTER>
   `taxonomy` seems to not exists or is empty. Should I clone git@github.com:instruct-lab/taxonomy.git for you? [y/N]: y
   Cloning git@github.com:instruct-lab/taxonomy.git...
   Generating `config.yaml` in the current directory...
   Initialization completed successfully, you're ready to start using `lab`. Enjoy!
   ```
   `ilab` will use the default configuration file unless otherwise specified. You can override this behavior with the `--config` parameter for any `ilab` command.

### 📥 Download the model

* Run the `ilab download`command.

  ```shell
  ilab download
  ```

  `ilab download` will download a pre-trained [model](https://huggingface.co/ibm/) (~4.4G) from HuggingFace and store it in a `models` directory:

  ```shell
  (venv) $ ilab download
  Downloading model from ibm/merlinite-7b-GGUF@main to models...
  (venv) $ ls models
  merlinite-7b-Q4_K_M.gguf
   ```

  > **NOTE** ⏳ This command can take few minutes or immediately depending on your internet connection or model is cached. If you have issues connecting to Hugging Face, refer to the [Hugging Face discussion forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/) for more details.


### 🍴 Serving the model

* Serve the model by running the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab serve
   ```

   Once the model is served and ready, you'll see the following output:

   ```shell
   (venv) $ ilab serve
   INFO 2024-03-02 02:21:11,352 lab.py:201 Using model 'models/ggml-merlinite-7b-0302-Q4_K_M.gguf' with -1 gpu-layers and 4096 max context size.
   Starting server process
   After application startup complete see http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs for API.
   Press CTRL+C to shut down the server.
   ```

   > **NOTE:** If multiple `ilab` clients try to connect to the same ilab server at the same time, the 1st will connect to the server while the others will start their own temporary server. This will require additional resources on the host machine.

### 📣 Chat with the model (Optional)

Because you're serving the model in one terminal window, you will have to create a new window and re-activate your Python virtual environment to run `ilab chat` command:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
$ilab chat
```

Before you start adding new skills and knowledge to your model, you can check its baseline performance by asking it a question such as `what is the capital of Canada?`.

> **NOTE:** the model needs to be trained with the generated synthetic data to use the new skills or knowledge

```

## 💻 Creating new knowledge or skills and training the model

### 🎁 Contribute knowledge or compositional skills

Contribute new knowledge or compositional skills to your local [taxonomy](https://github.com/instruct-lab/taxonomy.git) repository.

Detailed contribution instructions can be found in the [taxonomy repository](https://github.com/instruct-lab/taxonomy/blob/main/README.md).

### 📜 List and validate your new data

1. List your new data by running the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab diff
   ```

2. To ensure `ilab` is registering your new knowledge or skills, you can run the `ilab diff` command. The following is the expected result after adding the new compositional skill foo-lang:

   ```shell
   (venv) $ ilab diff
   compositional_skills/writing/freeform/foo-lang/foo-lang.yaml
   Taxonomy in /taxonomy/ is valid :)
   ```

### 🚀 Generate a synthetic dataset

1. To generate a synthetic dataset based on your newly added knowledge or skill set in [taxonomy](https://github.com/instruct-lab/taxonomy.git) repository, run the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab generate
   ```
   > **NOTE:** ⏳ This can take from 15 minutes to 1+ hours to complete, depending on your computing resources.

   #### Example output:

   ```shell
   (venv) $ ilab generate
   INFO 2024-02-29 19:09:48,804 lab.py:250 Generating model 'ggml-merlinite-7b-0302-Q4_K_M' using 10 CPUs,
   taxonomy: '/home/username/instruct-lab/taxonomy' and seed 'seed_tasks.json'

   0%|##########| 0/100 Cannot find prompt.txt. Using default prompt.
   98%|##########| 98/100 INFO 2024-02-29 20:49:27,582 generate_data.py:428 Generation took 5978.78s
   ```

   The synthetic data set will be three files in the newly created `generated` directory named `generated*.json`, `test*.jsonl`, and `train*.jsonl`.

2. Verify the files have been created by running the `ls generated` command.
   ```shell
   (venv) $ ls generated/
   'generated_ggml-merlinite-7b-0226-Q4_K_M_2024-02-29T19 09 48.json'   'train_ggml-merlinite-7b-0226-Q4_K_M_2024-02-29T19 09 48.jsonl'
   'test_ggml-merlinite-7b-0226-Q4_K_M_2024-02-29T19 09 48.jsonl'
   ```

   **Optional**: It is also possible to run the generate step against a different model via an
   OpenAI-compatible API. For example, the one spawned by `ilab serve` or any remote or locally hosted LLM (e.g. via [ollama](https://ollama.com/), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai), etc.). Run the following command:


   ```shell
   ilab generate --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000/v1
   ```

### 👩‍🏫 Train the model

There are three options to train the model on your synthetic data-enhanced dataset.

> **Note:** **Every** `ilab` command needs to be run from within your Python virtual environment.

#### Train the model locally on Linux

```
ilab train
```

> **NOTE:** ⏳ This step can take **several hours** to complete depending on your computing resources.

`ilab train` outputs a brand-new model that can be served in the `models` directory called `ggml-model-f16.gguf`.
```
 (venv) $ ls models
 ggml-merlinite-7b-0302-Q4_K_M.gguf  ggml-model-f16.gguf
```

> **NOTE:** `ilab train` ships with experimental support for GPU acceleration with Nvidia CUDA
or AMD ROCm. See [the GPU acceleration documentation](./docs/gpu-acceleration.md) for more
details.

#### Train the model locally on an M-series Mac:

To train the model locally on your M-Series Mac is as easy as running:
```
ilab train
```

> **Note:** ⏳ This process will take a little while to complete (time can vary based on hardware
and output of `ilab generate` but on the order of 20 minutes to 1+ hours)

`ilab train` outputs a brand-new model that is saved in the `<model_name>-mlx-q` directory called `adapters.npz` (in Numpy's compressed array format). For example:
```
(venv) $ ls ibm-merlinite-7b-mlx-q
adapters-010.npz        adapters-050.npz        adapters-090.npz        config.json             tokenizer.model
adapters-020.npz        adapters-060.npz        adapters-100.npz        model.safetensors       tokenizer_config.json
adapters-030.npz        adapters-070.npz        adapters.npz            special_tokens_map.json
adapters-040.npz        adapters-080.npz        added_tokens.json       tokenizer.jso
```

#### Training the model in the cloud

Follow the instructions in [Training](./notebooks/README.md).

⏳ Approximate amount of time taken on each platform:
- *Google Colab*: **0.5-2.5 hours** with a T4 GPU
- *Kaggle*: **~8 hours** with a P100 GPU.

After that's done, you can play with your model directly in the Google Colab or Kaggle notebook. Model trained on the cloud will be saved on the cloud.
The model can also be downloaded and served locally.

### 📜 Test the newly trained model


* Run the following command to test the model:

  ```shell
   ilab test
  ```
   > **NOTE:** 🍎 This step is only implemented for macOS with M-series chips (for now)

   The output from the command will consist of a series of outputs from the model before and after training.

### 🍴 Serve the newly trained model

1. Stop the server you have running by entering `ctrl+c` keys in the terminal running the server.

   > **IMPORTANT**:
   * 🍎 This step is only implemented for macOS with M-series chips (for now).

   * Before serving the newly trained model you must convert it to work with
   the `ilab` cli. The `ilab convert` command converts the new model into quantized [GGUF](https://medium.com/@sandyeep70/ggml-to-gguf-a-leap-in-language-model-file-formats-cd5d3a6058f9) format which is required by the server to host the model in the `ilab serve` command.

2. Convert the newly trained model by running the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab convert
   ```

3. Serve the newly trained model locally via `ilab serve` command with the `--model`
argument to specify your new model:

   ```shell
   ilab serve --model-path <New model name>
   ```

   Which model shouold you select to serve? After running the `ilab convert` command, a few files and directories are generated. The one you will want to serve will end in `.gguf`
   and will exist in a directory with the suffix `fused-pt`. For example:
   `ibm-merlinite-7b-mlx-q-fused-pt/ggml-model-Q4_K_M.gguf`

## 📣 Chat with the new model (not optional this time)

* Try the fine-tuned model out live using the chat interface, and see if the results are better than the untrained version of the model with chat by running the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab chat -m <New model name>
   ```

   If you are interested in optimizing the quality of the model's responses, please see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md#model-fine-tuning-and-response-optimization)

## 🎁 Submit your new knowledge or skills

Of course, the final step is, if you've improved the model, to open a pull-request in the [taxonomy repository](https://github.com/instruct-lab/taxonomy) that includes the files (e.g. `qna.yaml`) with your improved data.
