## Welcome to the InstructLab CLI

InstructLab üê∂ uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for
Large Language Models (LLMs.) The "**lab**" in Instruct**Lab** üê∂ stands for
[**L**arge-Scale **A**lignment for Chat**B**ots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081) [1].

[1] Shivchander Sudalairaj*, Abhishek Bhandwaldar*, Aldo Pareja*, Kai Xu, David D. Cox, Akash Srivastava*. "LAB: Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots", arXiv preprint arXiv: 2403.01081, 2024. (* denotes equal contributions)

## ‚ùì What is `ilab`

`ilab` is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool that allows you to perform the following actions:

1. Download a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM).
1. Chat with the LLM.

To add new knowledge and skills to the pre-trained LLM, add information to the companion [taxonomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy.git) repository.

After you have added knowledge and skills to the taxonomy, you can perform the following actions:

1. Use `ilab` to generate new synthetic training data based on the changes in your local `taxonomy` repository.
1. Re-train the LLM with the new training data.
1. Chat with the re-trained LLM to see the results.

  add[Add new knowledge\nor skill to taxonomy]-->generate[generate new\nsynthetic training data]
  generate-->train
  train[Re-train]-->|Chat with\nthe re-trained LLM\nto see the results|chat
```

For an overview of the full workflow, see the [workflow diagram](./docs/workflow.png).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We have optimized InstructLab so that community members with commodity hardware can perform these steps. However, running InstructLab on a laptop will provide a low-fidelity approximation of synthetic data generation
> (using the `ilab generate` command) and model instruction tuning (using the `ilab train` command, which uses QLoRA). To achieve higher quality, use more sophisticated hardware and configure InstructLab to use a
> larger teacher model [such as Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/mixtral).

## üìã Requirements

- **üçé Apple M1/M2/M3 Mac or üêß Linux system** (tested on Fedora). We anticipate support for more operating systems in the future.
- C++ compiler
- Python 3.9+ (<3.12 for PyTorch JIT)
- Approximately 60GB disk space (entire process)

> **NOTE:** PyTorch 2.2.1 does not support `torch.compile` with Python 3.12. On Fedora 39+, install `python3.11-devel` and create the virtual env with `python3.11` if you wish to use PyTorch's JIT compiler.
<!-- -->
> **NOTE:** When installing the `ilab` CLI on macOS, you may have to run the `xcode select --install` command, installing the required packages previously listed.

## ‚úÖ Getting started

### üß∞ Installing `ilab`

1. When installing on Fedora Linux, install C++, Python 3.9+, and other necessary tools by running the following command:

   ```shell
   sudo dnf install g++ gcc make pip python3 python3-devel python3-GitPython
   ```

   Optional: If `g++` is not found, try `gcc-c++` by running the following command:

   ```shell
   sudo dnf install gcc-c++ gcc make pip python3 python3-devel python3-GitPython
   ```

   If you are running on macOS, this installation is not necessary and you can begin your process with the following step.  

2. Create a new directory called `instructlab` to store the files the `ilab` CLI needs when running and `cd` into the directory by running the following command:

   ```shell
   mkdir instructlab
   cd instructlab
   ```

   > **NOTE:** The following steps in this document use [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for virtual environments. However, if you use another tool such as [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [Conda Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) for managing Python environments on your machine continue to use that tool instead. Otherwise, you may have issues with packages that are installed but not found in `venv`.

3. There are a few ways you can locally install the `ilab` CLI. Select your preferred installation method from the following instructions. You can then install `ilab` and activate your `venv` environment.

   > **NOTE**: ‚è≥ `pip install` may take some time, depending on your internet connection. In case installation fails with error ``unsupported instruction `vpdpbusd'``, append `-C cmake.args="-DLLAMA_NATIVE=off"` to `pip install` command.

   See [the GPU acceleration documentation](./docs/gpu-acceleration.md) for how to
   to enable hardware acceleration for interaction and training on AMD ROCm,
   Apple Metal Performance Shaders (MPS), and Nvidia CUDA.

   #### Install using PyTorch without CUDA bindings and no GPU acceleration

      ```shell
      python3 -m venv --upgrade-deps venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      pip cache remove llama_cpp_python
      pip install instructlab --extra-index-url=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
      ```

      > **NOTE**: *Additional Build Argument for Intel Macs*
      >
      > If you have an Mac with an Intel CPU, you must add a prefix of
      > `CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_METAL=off"` to the `pip install` command to ensure
      > that the build is done without Apple M-series GPU support.
      >
      > `(venv) $ CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_METAL=off" pip install ...`

   #### Install with AMD ROCm

      ```shell
      python3 -m venv --upgrade-deps venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      pip cache remove llama_cpp_python
      pip install instructlab \
         --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.0 \
         -C cmake.args="-DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=on" \
         -C cmake.args="-DAMDGPU_TARGETS=all" \
         -C cmake.args="-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang" \
         -C cmake.args="-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++" \
         -C cmake.args="-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/rocm"
      ```

      On Fedora 40+, use `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-17` and `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-17`.

   #### Install with Apple Metal on M1/M2/M3 Macs

      > **NOTE**: Make sure your system Python build is `Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64` by using `file -b $(command -v python)`.

      ```shell
      python3 -m venv --upgrade-deps venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      pip cache remove llama_cpp_python
      pip install instructlab
      ```

   #### Install with Nvidia CUDA

      ```shell
      python3 -m venv --upgrade-deps venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      pip cache remove llama_cpp_python
      pip install instructlab -C cmake.args="-DLLAMA_CUDA=on"
   ```

4. From your `venv` environment, verify `ilab` is installed correctly, by running the `ilab` command.

   ```shell
   ilab
   ```

   *Example output of the `ilab` command*

   ```shell
   (venv) $ ilab
   Usage: ilab [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

   CLI for interacting with InstructLab.

   If this is your first time running InstructLab, it's best to start with `ilab init` to create the environment.

   Options:
   --config PATH  Path to a configuration file.  [default: config.yaml]
   --version      Show the version and exit.
   --help         Show this message and exit.

   Commands:
   chat      Run a chat using the modified model
   check     (Deprecated) Check that taxonomy is valid
   convert   Converts model to GGUF
   diff      Lists taxonomy files that have changed since <taxonomy-base>...
   download  Download the model(s) to train
   generate  Generates synthetic data to enhance your example data
   init      Initializes environment for InstructLab
   list      (Deprecated) Lists taxonomy files that have changed since <taxonomy-base>.
   serve     Start a local server
   test      Runs basic test to ensure model correctness
   train     Takes synthetic data generated locally with `ilab generate`...
   ```

   > **IMPORTANT:** every `ilab` command needs to be run from within your Python virtual environment. To enter the Python environment, run the following command:

   ```shell
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Optional: You can enable tab completion for the `ilab` command.

   #### Bash (version 4.4 or newer)

   Enable tab completion in `bash` with the following command:

   ```sh
   eval "$(_ILAB_COMPLETE=bash_source ilab)"
   ```

   To have this enabled automatically every time you open a new shell,
   you can save the completion script and source it from `~/.bashrc`:

   ```sh
   _ILAB_COMPLETE=bash_source ilab > ~/.ilab-complete.bash
   echo ". ~/.ilab-complete.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

   #### Zsh

   Enable tab completion in `zsh` with the following command:

   ```sh
   eval "$(_ILAB_COMPLETE=zsh_source ilab)"
   ```

   To have this enabled automatically every time you open a new shell,
   you can save the completion script and source it from `~/.zshrc`:

   ```sh
   _ILAB_COMPLETE=zsh_source ilab > ~/.ilab-complete.zsh
   echo ". ~/.ilab-complete.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

   #### Fish

   Enable tab completion in `fish` with the following command:

   ```sh
   _ILAB_COMPLETE=fish_source ilab | source
   ```

   To have this enabled automatically every time you open a new shell,
   you can save the completion script and source it from `~/.bashrc`:

   ```sh
   _ILAB_COMPLETE=fish_source ilab > ~/.config/fish/completions/ilab.fish
   ```

### üèóÔ∏è Initialize `ilab`

1. Initialize `ilab` by running the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab init
   ```

   *Example output*

   ```shell
   Welcome to InstructLab CLI. This guide will help you set up your environment.
   Please provide the following values to initiate the environment [press Enter for defaults]:
   Path to taxonomy repo [taxonomy]: <ENTER>
   ```

2. When prompted by the interface, press **Enter** to add a new default `config.yaml` file.

3. When prompted, clone the `https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy.git` repository into the current directory by typing **y**.

   **Optional**: If you want to point to an existing local clone of the `taxonomy` repository, you can pass the path interactively or alternatively with the `--taxonomy-path` flag.

   *Example output after initializing `ilab`*

   ```shell
   (venv) $ ilab init
   Welcome to InstructLab CLI. This guide will help you set up your environment.
   Please provide the following values to initiate the environment [press Enter for defaults]:
   Path to taxonomy repo [taxonomy]: <ENTER>
   `taxonomy` seems to not exists or is empty. Should I clone https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy.git for you? [y/N]: y
   Cloning https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy.git...
   Generating `config.yaml` in the current directory...
   Initialization completed successfully, you're ready to start using `ilab`. Enjoy!
   ```

   `ilab` will use the default configuration file unless otherwise specified. You can override this behavior with the `--config` parameter for any `ilab` command.

   The taxonomy repository uses [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to incorporate the [taxonomy schema](https://github.com/instructlab/schema.git).
   When the `ilab init` command clones the taxonomy repository, it automatically handles the submodules.
   If you clone the taxonomy repository yourself, be sure to use the [`--recurse-submodules`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---recurse-submodulesltpathspecgt) option on the `git clone` command and the `git pull` command when pulling updates from the remote repository.
   For example:

   ```shell
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy.git
   git pull --recurse-submodules
   ```

### üì• Download the model

- Run the `ilab download` command.

  ```shell
  ilab download
  ```

  `ilab download` downloads a compact pre-trained version of the [model](https://huggingface.co/instructlab/) (~4.4G) from HuggingFace and store it in a `models` directory:

  ```shell
  (venv) $ ilab download
  Downloading model from instructlab/merlinite-7b-lab-GGUF@main to models...
  (venv) $ ls models
  merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf
  ```

  > **NOTE** ‚è≥ This command can take few minutes or immediately depending on your internet connection or model is cached. If you have issues connecting to Hugging Face, refer to the [Hugging Face discussion forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/) for more details.

  #### Downloading a specific model from a Hugging Face repository

- Specify repository, model, and a Hugging Face token if necessary. More information about Hugging Face tokens can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens)

  ```shell
  HF_TOKEN=<YOUR HUGGINGFACE TOKEN GOES HERE> ilab download --repository=TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF --filename=mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf
  ```

  #### Downloading an entire Hugging Face repository

- Specify repository, and a Hugging Face token if necessary. For example:

  ```shell
  HF_TOKEN=<YOUR HUGGINGFACE TOKEN GOES HERE> ilab download --repository=mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1
  ```

### üç¥ Serving the model

- Serve the model by running the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab serve
   ```

   Once the model is served and ready, you'll see the following output:

   ```shell
   (venv) $ ilab serve
   INFO 2024-03-02 02:21:11,352 lab.py:201 Using model 'models/ggml-merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf' with -1 gpu-layers and 4096 max context size.
   Starting server process
   After application startup complete see http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs for API.
   Press CTRL+C to shut down the server.
   ```

   > **NOTE:** If multiple `ilab` clients try to connect to the same InstructLab server at the same time, the 1st will connect to the server while the others will start their own temporary server. This will require additional resources on the host machine.

### üì£ Chat with the model (Optional)

Because you're serving the model in one terminal window, you will have to create a new window and re-activate your Python virtual environment to run `ilab chat` command:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
ilab chat
```

Before you start adding new skills and knowledge to your model, you can check its baseline performance by asking it a question such as `what is the capital of Canada?`.

> **NOTE:** the model needs to be trained with the generated synthetic data to use the new skills or knowledge

```shell
(venv) $ ilab chat

## üíª Creating new knowledge or skills and training the model

### üéÅ Contribute knowledge or compositional skills

1. Contribute new knowledge or compositional skills to your local [taxonomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy.git) repository.

Detailed contribution instructions can be found in the [taxonomy repository](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/blob/main/README.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is a limit to how much content can exist in the question/answer pairs for the model to process. Due to this, only add a maximum of around 2300 words to your question and answer seed example pairs in the `qna.yaml` file.

### üìú List and validate your new data

1. List your new data by running the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab diff
   ```

2. To ensure `ilab` is registering your new knowledge or skills, you can run the `ilab diff` command. The following is the expected result after adding the new compositional skill `foo-lang`:

   ```shell
   (venv) $ ilab diff
   compositional_skills/writing/freeform/foo-lang/foo-lang.yaml
   Taxonomy in /taxonomy/ is valid :)
   ```

### üöÄ Generate a synthetic dataset

Before following these instructions, ensure the existing model you are adding skills or knowledge to is still running.

1. To generate a synthetic dataset based on your newly added knowledge or skill set in [taxonomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy.git) repository, run the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab generate
   ```

   > **NOTE:** ‚è≥ This can take from 15 minutes to 1+ hours to complete, depending on your computing resources.

   *Example output of `ilab generate`*

   ```shell
   (venv) $ ilab generate
   INFO 2024-02-29 19:09:48,804 lab.py:250 Generating model 'ggml-merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M' using 10 CPUs,
   taxonomy: '/home/username/instructlab/taxonomy' and seed 'seed_tasks.json'

   0%|##########| 0/100 Cannot find prompt.txt. Using default prompt.
   98%|##########| 98/100 INFO 2024-02-29 20:49:27,582 generate_data.py:428 Generation took 5978.78s
   ```

   The synthetic data set will be three files in the newly created `generated` directory named `generated*.json`, `test*.jsonl`, and `train*.jsonl`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to pickup from where a failed or canceled `ilab generate` left off, you can copy the
> `generated*.json` file into a file named `regen.json`. `regen.json` will be picked up at the start of `lab
> generate` when available. You should remove it when the process is completed.

2. Verify the files have been created by running the `ls generated` command.

   ```shell
   (venv) $ ls generated/
   'generated_ggml-merlinite-7b-lab-0226-Q4_K_M_2024-02-29T19 09 48.json'   'train_ggml-merlinite-7b-lab-0226-Q4_K_M_2024-02-29T19 09 48.jsonl'
   'test_ggml-merlinite-7b-lab-0226-Q4_K_M_2024-02-29T19 09 48.jsonl'
   ```

   **Optional**: It is also possible to run the generate step against a different model via an
   OpenAI-compatible API. For example, the one spawned by `ilab serve` or any remote or locally hosted LLM (e.g. via [`ollama`](https://ollama.com/), [`LM Studio`](https://lmstudio.ai), etc.). Run the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab generate --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000/v1
   ```

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Training the model

There are many options for training the model with your synthetic data-enhanced dataset.

> **Note:** **Every** `ilab` command needs to run from within your Python virtual environment.

#### Train the model locally on Linux

```shell
ilab train
```

> **NOTE:** ‚è≥ This step can potentially take **several hours** to complete depending on your computing resources. Please stop `ilab chat` and `ilab serve` first to free resources.

`ilab train` outputs a brand-new model that can be served in the `models` directory called `ggml-model-f16.gguf`.

```shell
 (venv) $ ls models
 ggml-merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf  ggml-model-f16.gguf
```

#### Train the model locally on an M-series Mac

To train the model locally on your M-Series Mac is as easy as running:

```shell
ilab train
```

> **Note:** ‚è≥ This process will take a little while to complete (time can vary based on hardware
and output of `ilab generate` but on the order of 5 to 15 minutes)

`ilab train` outputs a brand-new model that is saved in the `<model_name>-mlx-q` directory called `adapters.npz` (in `Numpy` compressed array format). For example:

```shell
(venv) $ ls instructlab-merlinite-7b-lab-mlx-q
adapters-010.npz        adapters-050.npz        adapters-090.npz        config.json             tokenizer.model
adapters-020.npz        adapters-060.npz        adapters-100.npz        model.safetensors       tokenizer_config.json
adapters-030.npz        adapters-070.npz        adapters.npz            special_tokens_map.json
adapters-040.npz        adapters-080.npz        added_tokens.json       tokenizer.jso
```

#### Train the model locally with GPU acceleration

Training has experimental support for GPU acceleration with Nvidia CUDA or AMD ROCm. Please see [the GPU acceleration documentation](./docs/gpu-acceleration.md) for more details. At present, hardware acceleration requires a data center GPU or high-end consumer GPU with at least 18 GB free memory.

```shell
ilab train --device=cuda
```

#### Train the model in the cloud

Follow the instructions in [Training](./notebooks/README.md).

‚è≥ Approximate amount of time taken on each platform:

- *Google Colab*: **5-10 minutes** with a T4 GPU
- *Kaggle*: **~30 minutes** with a P100 GPU.

After that's done, you can play with your model directly in the Google Colab or Kaggle notebook. Model trained on the cloud will be saved on the cloud.
The model can also be downloaded and served locally.

### üìú Test the newly trained model

- Run the following command to test the model:

   ```shell
   ilab test
   ```

   > **NOTE:** üçé This step is only implemented for macOS with M-series chips (for now)

   The output from the command will consist of a series of outputs from the model before and after training.

### üç¥ Serve the newly trained model

1. Stop the server you have running by entering `ctrl+c` keys in the terminal running the server.

   > **IMPORTANT**:
   - üçé This step is only implemented for macOS with M-series chips (for now).

   - Before serving the newly trained model you must convert it to work with
   the `ilab` cli. The `ilab convert` command converts the new model into quantized [GGUF](https://medium.com/@sandyeep70/ggml-to-gguf-a-leap-in-language-model-file-formats-cd5d3a6058f9) format which is required by the server to host the model in the `ilab serve` command.

2. Convert the newly trained model by running the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab convert
   ```

3. Serve the newly trained model locally via `ilab serve` command with the `--model-path`
argument to specify your new model:

   ```shell
   ilab serve --model-path <new model path>
   ```

   Which model should you select to serve? After running the `ilab convert` command, some files and a directory are generated. The model you will want to serve ends with an extension of `.gguf`
   and exists in a directory with the suffix `trained`. For example:
   `instructlab-merlinite-7b-lab-trained/instructlab-merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf`.

## üì£ Chat with the new model (not optional this time)

- Try the fine-tuned model out live using the chat interface, and see if the results are better than the untrained version of the model with chat by running the following command:

   ```shell
   ilab chat -m <New model name>
   ```

   If you are interested in optimizing the quality of the model's responses, please see [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md#model-fine-tuning-and-response-optimization)

## üéÅ Submit your new knowledge or skills

Of course, the final step is, if you've improved the model, to open a pull-request in the [taxonomy repository](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy) that includes the files (e.g. `qna.yaml`) with your improved data.
