      # tox creates (and reuses) a separate Python (virtual) environment for each context (fmt, lint)
      # tox requires (and will install, if not exists) all the packages listed in requirements.txt
      # so we want to cache the entire Python environment, not just the pip cache as tox will not reuse that
      # but caching tox environments is fickle and can cause weird errors
      # tox does provide a legacy option to reuse the Python system wide site packages
      # since GH action runners are one-and-done we can install all requirements into the system packages
      # and cache and reuse all of the installed Python system packages
      # tox can then reuse the system site packages with setting `-x testenv:lint.system_site_packages=True`
