# Installing InstructLab on Windows using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

## ATTENTION: This process is not officially supported by InstructLab. It is a community contribution, and should not be interpreted as official documentation

This tutorial describes the full process of running InstructLab on WSL, from installation of WSL to the initialization of InstructLab.

This tutorial will use the following software tools and packages:

- Windows PowerShell

- WSL

- Ubuntu

- `python3.11`

- `python3.11-dev`

- `build-essential`

## Installing WSL

To install WSL, first open up Powershell. The following command installs the necessary features for WSL and the Ubuntu distro as default. The default distro can be changed with `wsl --list -d <DistributionName>`.
>NOTE: As of writing, Fedora is not supported with WSL so the tutorial proceeds with using Ubuntu.

```PowerShell
wsl --install
```

WSL is installed.

To run WSL, simply type the following command to set up the Linux environment in Powershell:

```PowerShell
wsl
```

## Installing InstructLab

From here, proceed with setting up InstructLab within the Linux environment. The following instructions are a mix of both the official InstructLab documentation as well as the WSL installation/setup process.

First, update and upgrade the Linux environment to ensure all of your installed packages are up-to-date.

```WSL
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

And install `build-essential`:

```WSL
sudo apt install build-essential
```

Install the requisite packages:
>NOTE: Since WSL uses Ubuntu as the default distro, use `apt install` instead of `dnf install` as is stated in the official InstructLab documentation.

```WSL
sudo apt install gcc g++ make git python3.11 python3.11-dev
```

From here, follow from Step #2 under [Installing `ilab`](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started) in the root directory.

And there you go! You have InstructLab setup on your Windows machine (using Linux) through WSL! But it doesnâ€™t stop here. You still need to download your model, generate your synthetic test data, train your model, test it, and even talk to it. If you end up not having enough VRAM to train your models locally (like me), you can use a cloud service like Google Colab. I highly recommend checking out the [official documentation](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab) for these next steps. I will also be releasing more tutorials as I go through my InstructLab journey, so stay tuned!
