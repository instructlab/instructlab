Workflow figure is generated using [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/ditaa) with the [ditaa](https://ditaa.sourceforge.net).
To generate it yourself, the easist way is to install the [PlantUML plugin in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) (with the pre-requiste installed), open the file and click preview.
You might need to use the following settings to make the preview work:
```json
"plantuml.render": "PlantUMLServer",
"plantuml.server": "https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml",
```
