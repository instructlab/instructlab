# CI for InstructLab

## Unit tests

All unit tests currently live in the `tests/` directory.

## Functional tests

The functional test script can be found at `scripts/functional-tests.sh`

## End-to-end (E2E) tests

The end-to-end test script can be found at `scripts/basic-workflow-tests.sh`.
This script takes arguments that control which features are used to allow
varying test coverage based on the resources available on a given test runner.

There is currently a ["small" t-shirt size E2E job](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/blob/main/.github/workflows/e2e-nvidia-t4-x1.yml)
that runs automatically on all PRs and after commits merge to `main` or release
branches.

There is also a ["medium" t-shirt size E2E job](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/blob/main/.github/workflows/e2e-nvidia-a10g-x1.yml) and ["large" t-shirt size E2E job](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/blob/main/.github/workflows/e2e-nvidia-a10g-x4.yml) that can be triggered manually on the [actions
page](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/actions) for the repository.
These run on a variety of instance types and can be run at the discretion of
repo maintainers.

The "large" t-shirt size E2E job also runs automatically against the `main` branch at 8AM and 8PM UTC every day.

### E2E Test Coverage Options

You can specify the following flags to test various features of `ilab` with the
`basic-workflow-tests.sh` script - you can see examples of these being used within
the E2E job configuration files found
[here](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/blob/main/.github/workflows/).

| Flag | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| `e` | Run model evaluation |
| `F` | Run "fullsize" SDG |
| `L` | Run legacy training |
| `m` | Run minimal configuration (lower number of instructions and training epochs) |
| `M` | Use Mixtral model (4-bit quantized) instead of Merlinite (4-bit quantized) |
| `P` | Use the phased training within the 'full' training library |
| `T` | Use the 'full' training library rather than legacy training |
| `v` | Run with vLLM for serving |

Points of clarification (*):

1. The `training-lib` testing is not testing using the output of the Generate step. <https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/issues/1655>
2. The `eval` testing is not evaluating the output of the Training step. <https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/issues/1540>

### Slack reporting

Some E2E jobs send their results to the InstructLab Slack workspace channel `#cli-e2e-results` via the `Son of Jeeves` bot. This has been implemented
via [the official Slack GitHub Action](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-github-action?tab=readme-ov-file#technique-2-slack-app). You can see which jobs currently have reporting via the "Current E2E Jobs" table above.

### Triggering an E2E job via GitHub Web UI

For the E2E jobs that can be launched manually, they take an input field that
specifies the PR number or git branch to run them against. If you run them
against a PR, they will automatically post a comment to the PR when the tests
begin and end so it's easier for those involved in the PR to follow the results.

1. Visit the [Actions tab](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/actions).
2. Click on one of the E2E workflows on the left side of the page.
3. Click on the `Run workflow` button on the right side of the page.
4. Enter a branch name or a PR number in the input field.
5. Click the green `Run workflow` button.

Here is an example of using the GitHub Web UI to launch an E2E workflow:
